## üîÑ Scheduled Jobs

The application uses Laravel's Task Scheduler to automate content curation. Here's a detailed breakdown of each job:

### 1. News Fetching (`news:fetch`)
**Schedule**: Runs every 4 hours
**Command**: `php artisan news:fetch`
**Location**: `app/Console/Commands/FetchNewsCommand.php`

This command performs the following steps:
1. **Article Fetching**
   - Connects to NewsAPI using the configured API key
   - Searches for workplace-related articles using predefined keywords
   - Filters out duplicate articles based on URL

2. **Content Analysis**
   - For each article:
     - Sends the article content to OpenAI for analysis
     - Evaluates relevance to workplace topics
     - Assigns a score (1-10) based on alignment with Radio Hamkar's goals
     - If score < 8, skips further processing

3. **Content Generation**
   - For articles with score ‚â• 8:
     - Generates a LinkedIn post in Farsi using GPT-4
     - Creates a relevant image using DALL¬∑E
     - Saves the image locally in the storage directory

4. **Database Storage**
   - Saves article details including:
     - Title, description, source, URL
     - Generated LinkedIn post
     - Image path
     - Relevance score
     - Analysis results

**Logging**: All activities are logged to `storage/logs/schedule-news-fetch.log`

### 2. News Regeneration (`news:regenerate`)
**Schedule**: Runs daily at midnight
**Command**: `php artisan news:regenerate`
**Location**: `app/Console/Commands/RegenerateNewsCommand.php`

This command handles content refreshing:
1. **Article Selection**
   - Retrieves articles from the database that:
     - Have high relevance scores (‚â• 8)
     - Haven't been approved or rejected yet
     - Are less than 7 days old

2. **Content Refresh**
   - For each selected article:
     - Regenerates the LinkedIn post with fresh perspective
     - Creates a new DALL¬∑E image
     - Updates the database with new content

3. **Cleanup**
   - Removes old generated images
   - Updates article timestamps
   - Maintains storage efficiency

**Logging**: All regeneration activities are logged to `storage/logs/schedule-news-regenerate.log`

### Job Configuration
Both jobs are configured in `app/Console/Kernel.php`:
```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule): void
{
    $schedule->command('news:fetch')
        ->everyFourHours()
        ->appendOutputTo(storage_path('logs/schedule-news-fetch.log'));

    $schedule->command('news:regenerate')
        ->daily()
        ->appendOutputTo(storage_path('logs/schedule-news-regenerate.log'));
}
```

### Monitoring Jobs
You can monitor job execution in several ways:
1. Check the log files in `storage/logs/`
2. Use Laravel's built-in scheduling commands:
   ```bash
   # List all scheduled tasks
   docker-compose exec php-fpm php artisan schedule:list
   
   # Test run a specific command
   docker-compose exec php-fpm php artisan news:fetch
   docker-compose exec php-fpm php artisan news:regenerate
   ```

3. View the supervisor process logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs php-fpm
   ```
